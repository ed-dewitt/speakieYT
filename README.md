Welcome to this tutorial.

A couple of things to take into consideration:

- I know the names could be better; feel free to change them to your liking, at the end, my intention here is to teach you how to create this design using TailwindCSS.
- I used a bit of pure CSS for the animations part.
- I already gave you predefined stuff that you can check out in the tailwind.config.js file, this so we don't have to go through the configuration hassle and focus purely on the Tailwind part.
- You will have to create your account to use the icons and put the proper "script" tag in the index.html file. I left a note in lines 9-10 of the index.html file as an example.
- You will have to install the packages. For that, just execute this command "npm install" in the console and you will be all set up.
- To start the project, run "npm run dev", open the index.html file in a web browser, and now you're good to go.

Hope you like it and thank you for watching!
There will be more coming soon, so stay tuned.
